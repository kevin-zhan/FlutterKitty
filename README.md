# FlutterKitty

The project is modified from [DailyZhihu](https://github.com/kevin-zhan/DailyZhihu) for learning more flutter widget. Of courese, cute kitties are also the main move for the proj.  
Hope you'll like the app.

## Build Tip
If you cannot find model.g.dart file and unable to build the project, try run the command `flutter packages pub run build_runner watch` in the root dir of the project.

## Thanks
I don't have much time to find kitty images. Luckily, [TheCatApi](https://thecatapi.com/) provides me some great resource. And thus, for simple use, I don't need to develop my own server.
